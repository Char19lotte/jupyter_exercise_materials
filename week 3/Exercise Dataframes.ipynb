Because we are only looking at employed people, we will be estimating the relationship between education and income for people who are employed. That means that if education affects the likelihood someone is employed, we won’t capture that in this analysis.

    "Why do you think there is no benefit from moving from grade 9 to grade 10, or grade 10 to grade 11, but there is a huge benefit to moving from grade 11 to graduating high school (grade 12)?\n",
    "- Moving from grade 9 to grade 10 or grade 11 does not yield a certificate or diploma (*potentially interesting side note: in Germany it does! When you graduate grade 10, you could potentially get a diploma, when you decide to leave school, it's called \"Mittlere Reife\"*). However, when you graduate high school, even though you might only know marginally more than when you were in grade 11, you get a diploma and that might distinguish you in the eyes of an employer. This reminded me of the \"markets of lemons\" in economics, when there is asymmetric information. In this way maybe a diploma is an indicator for an employer to see that yes, the employee is qualified to finish high school (i.e. disciplined, smart, driven, etc) and ergo qualified to work, whereas when you finish only with grade 11, while you might know only a little less, you lack that drive to get a diploma and might signal you are not a qualified employee. Overall, however, there might be other mechanisms at work too, like confounding factors. People who finish high school and people who only finish grade 11 might not be comparable and there might be other factors that differentiate them, apart from having a diploma. If you do not finish high school you might overall be less driven, less intelligent or just strive for a different career. Nevertheless, the effect of a diploma as a signal seems to be a good starting point to explain the question at hand. "
